	The <strong>Daytime</strong> condition uses astronomical calculations based on a specified geographic location to determine the time of sunrise and sunset.
	<br/><br/>
	This plug-in does not utilize background services. Instead it uses the AlarmManager to set time triggers to fire off on next event (either sunrise or sunset). One pending alarm per active condition. The plug-in never re-calculates the sunrise/sunset if there is already a pending alarm for that particular condition, even if Locale is automatically querying the plug-in. This ensures that the battery consumption is kept to a minimum.
