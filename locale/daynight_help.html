	The <strong>Day &amp; Night</strong> condition uses astronomical calculations based on a specified geographic location to determine the time of sunrise and sunset.
	<br/><br/>
	This plug-in does not utilize background services. Instead it uses the AlarmManager to set time triggers to fire off on next event (either sunrise or sunset). One pending alarm per active condition. The plug-in never re-calculates the sunrise/sunset if there is already a pending alarm for that particular condition, even if Locale is automatically querying the plug-in. This ensures that the battery consumption is kept to a minimum.
	<br/><br/>
	<strong>Note:</strong> Due to a limitation in the plug-in, switch from Daytime to Nighttime (or vice versa) on an active condition will have no effect until next event (next sunrise or sunset). I.e. the condition will not return correct state until next event. You can, however, by-pass this issue by changing the location. A slight change is enough but at least a hundredth of a degree in either latitude or longitude.
