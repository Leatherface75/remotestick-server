<h3>Tellstick</h3>
Remotestick revolves around <em>Tellstick</em>. Tellstick comes in a <a href="http://www.telldus.com/products/comparison">few different flavors</a>, manufactured by the Swedish company <a href="http://www.telldus.se">Telldus</a>, <em>"turns any computer into a wireless home automation center by being the link between your computer and electronics & lights"</em> (quoted from Telldus web site). Telldus has a <a href="http://www.telldus.se/retailer/show?id=17">list of retailers</a> if you are interested in buying one. At the time of this writing, Tellstick comes in three different kinds; Tellstick, Tellstick Duo and Tellstick Net. Only the two latter ones is capable of receiving signals which is essential if you plan on monitoring sensors. Also, only the Tellstick Net has built-in schedule support. If you don't have the Tellstick Net you can still schedule events if you combine Remotestick with Tasker or Locale. All three are capable of transmitting signals in order to control different kind of devices, like power sockets, light bulbs, switch converters and many more.
