Unfortunately I've had e-mail issues once again. If you've mailed me recently and haven't got a response, please mail me again!

My hosting company re-directs mail from hello@remotestick.org to another address and for some reason this stopped working a couple of days ago. I have now completely transfered mail handling for remotestick.org to Google Apps and so mails have started dropping in again.

Happy remoting!
