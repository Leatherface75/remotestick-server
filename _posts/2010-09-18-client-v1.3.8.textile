A couple of weeks ago I got a request from a member on swedroid.se to implement continuously dim slider update. I tried but had some troubles getting it through to the server side smoothly without affecting the user experience in the android app negatively. And so I left the issue for the moment and later forgot it completly. Today I was rememberd about the request and I had it another go with much more success. 1.3.8 is now out with the only change being continuously updating the dimmer slider. 

Happy remoting!
