h2. {{ page.title }}

v1.3.9 should be available on Market now. It supports adding devices with non-ascii characters (finally!). A few FC's have been fixed as well, thanks for the reports!
Oh, and I've also removed Google Analytics from the app since I didn't really make any use of it.

A *donate version* of the app is out as well. It goes for 10 SEK (~ $1.5 or â‚¬1) and there is no difference between the two versions. If you appreciate the app, please consider buying the donate version. 

Happy remoting!
