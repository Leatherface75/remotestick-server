h2. {{ page.title }}

Just recently released a Locale condition plug-in for daytime and nighttime based on sunrise and sunset calculations. Will add some nice extra features to the plug-in soon. Perhaps it will come in handy for some of you who uses the RemoteStick Locale plug-in. Or any other Locale user for that matter!

Search for Day & Night Locale plug-in on Market and you should find it.

Happy remoting!
